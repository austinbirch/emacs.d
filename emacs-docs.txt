General:
try to use Capslock as Control wherever possible
C-. is my new m-x
- meta-up moves text up
- meta-down moves text down
- s-5 -> Delete Window
- s-0 -> Line-Numbers on / off

Insert Umlaut
C-x 8 " a (or o u, etc)
Even better, do m-x accents and then
a" will enter the ä

 C-h ?
Here are my favorites:
If you want to see a specific keybinding, like checking what C-w is bound to:
    C-h k C-w
If you want to see the documentation for a function:
    C-h f function-name
If you want to see details about your current mode:
    C-h m
This is incredibly useful because it lists all the mode-specific keybindings. That's how I learn how to use new modes!
If you want to see or interact with a variable:
    C-h v
If you want to see something where you remember just part of the name:
    C-h a *regexp*

Evil Leader:
,t      Toggle back and forth between last buffers
,p      Go to previous buffer (i.e. back button)
,n      Open new empty buffer
,i      iMenu -> List all functions in this buffer and jump around

,re     Recent open files
,rl     Revert current buffer (reload)

,l      List all open buffers (care, this mode is not evil-compatible!)

,c      Close current Window

,:      Command history (like vim recent commands, not perfect but close)
,f      Ace-Jump (i.e. Vim EasyMotion)
,/      Toggle comments

Evil-Surround:
- You can surround in visual-state with s<textobject><trigger> or in normal-state with ys<textobject><trigger> (i.e. ysw')
- You can change a surrounding with cs<old-trigger><new-trigger> (i.e. cs*')
- You can delete a surrounding with cd<old-trigger><new-trigger>.
- i.e: 'Hello world!' -> cs'<q> -> <q>Hello world!</q>

Omnicomnpletion:
mx omnicompletion-like-vim loads vim like omnicompletion for all words
s-. -> helm-complete-filename-at-point: press this for filename completion in a buffer
s-/ -> Hippie Expand, but doesn't have a menu either

Search:
helm-do-grep for fast grep in current diredtory and what not !
mx ack is a better and faster search then grep or helm-do-grep

Navigation:
C-` is the mode where each buffer shows a number
C-c SPC -> ace jump mode
C-u C-u C-c SPC” ⇒ ace-jump-line-mode
mx helm-bookmarks allows to set bookmarks to often-used files

Narrow / Widen:
- 'narrow-to-region
- 'widen

Zencoding:
<C-j>

lisp:
C-x C-e OR C-' -> Eval  Expression
C-5 (i.e. anstatt % (shift-5)) -> in evil visual selection of block form (), {}, [], ...

Paredit:
C-j => break and continue
C-d => forward-delete
M-d => forward-delete word
M-DEL => backwards delete word
M-<Up> => splice sexp killing backward (remove sexp before cursor)
M-<Down> => splice sexp killing forward (remove sexp before cursor)
M-r => raise sexp, some weird stuff that moves the current sexp up
C-) => (use caps lock + shift + 0) move the next sexp into the current one. cursor is *in* the current expression
C-} => move the next sexp away from the current one
C-( => (use caps lock + shift + 9) move the previous sexp into the current one. cursor is *in* the current expression
C-{ => move the previous sexp away from the current one


Org-mode:
[[http://orgmode.org/org.html][Huge Main Org Mode Doc]]

Org-mode also has different begin_src blocks, like, say, begin_quote or html or latex
http://orgmode.org/org.html#Easy-Templates

http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto.html
- truncation: toggle-truncate-lines
- create linke: C-c C-l -> either paste link, or be with the cursor over a link
- all *, **, etc inserts have to have no indetation.
- * M-shift-RET to insert another headline on the same level
- C-c C-t to cycle a task from Todo to Done
- shift-tab gives overviews of documents
http://orgmode.org/guide/Plain-lists.html#Plain-lists
- Unordered list items start with ‘-’, ‘+’, or ‘*’ as bullets.
- Ordered list items start with ‘1.’ or ‘1)’.
- Description list use ‘ :: ’ to separate the term from the description.
- C-c C-c (if there's a checkbox) check or uncheck it
Org-Table:
http://orgmode.org/guide/Tables.html#Tables
- Create table: Just type the Table signature |Name|Phone|Age|More   and hit C-c RET
- Insert row: Just TAB through the colums and new rows will appear
- C-c C-c: Realign Table without moving the cursor
- C-c -: Insert new horiontal line below cursor
- C-c ^: Sort table (has to be in the column to be sorted)
http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-spreadsheet-intro.html
- To insert a formula, type like this :=vmean(@2$3..@4$3)
- To see column / row lables for formula, do C-c }
- TO update formulas, go to the TBLFM line and type C-c C-c
- Better Formula editing: C-' and then use S-left/S-right etc on the markers to shift the formulas

#+begin_src python
-- python code
#+end_src
insert codes. if I'm in one of htese blocks, C-c ' will open it in a buffer for editing. in there C-c ' will close the buffer and save

s    #+begin_src ... #+end_src 
e    #+begin_example ... #+end_example
q    #+begin_quote ... #+end_quote 
v    #+begin_verse ... #+end_verse 
c    #+begin_center ... #+end_center 


C-c ? Will give me the field reference

DEBUGGING:
I use debug. These are common entry points (ways to use it)
- M-x debug-on-entry followed by a function you want to enter using the debugger.
- M-x toggle-debug-on-error -- Enter the debugger when when an error is raised.
- M-x toggle-debug-on-quit -- Enter the debugger when the user hits C-g.

- Place explicit calls to function debug at particular places (breakpoints) in your code, to enter the debugger at those places
    (debug)
- You step through the debugger using d, or c to skip over the details of a particular evaluation.


EDITING THE CONETNS OF MULTIPLE FILES:
// http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/find_replace_inter.html
Call dired to list files in dir, or call find-dired if you need all subdirectories.
Mark the files you want. You can mark by regex by typing 【% m】.
Type Q to call dired-do-query-replace-regexp.
Type your find regex and replace string. 〔☛ common elisp regex pattern〕
For each occurrence, type y to replace, n to skip. Type 【Ctrl+g】 to abort the whole operation.
Type ! to replace all occurrences in current file without asking, N to skip all possible replacement for rest of the current file. (N is emacs 23 only)
To do the replacement on all files without further asking, type Y. (Emacs 23 only)
Call ibuffer to list all opened files.
Type 【* u】 to mark all unsaved files, type S to save all marked files, type D to close them all.

Interesting Extensions:

fiplr: Fuzzy file finder like the one in vim
            -> fiplr-find-file
grizzl: fast fuzzy search index, used by fiplr

htmlize: Convert the current buffer with syntax coloring to html. sadly, doesn't work with my color settings / scheme

Fantastic javascript completion via

Twiddle-Mode
This is a program for testing hand-written HTTP requests. You write your request in an Emacs buffer (using http-twiddle-mode) and then press `C-c C-c' each time you want to try sending it to the server. This way you can interactively debug the requests. To change port or
destination do `C-u C-c C-c'.

The mode is activated by `M-x http-twiddle-mode' or automatically
when opening a filename ending with .http-twiddle.

Example buffer

POST / HTTP/1.0
Connection: close
Content-Length: $Content-Length

<The request body goes here>

GET /user/bob/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

POST:

POST /user/create/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: text/xml
Connection: close
