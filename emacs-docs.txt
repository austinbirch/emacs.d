General:
try to use Capslock as Control wherever possible
C-. is my new m-x
- meta-up moves text up
- meta-down moves text down
- s-5 -> Delete Window
- s-0 -> Line-Numbers on / off

Evil Leader:
,t      Toggle back and forth between last buffers
,p      Go to previous buffer (i.e. back button)
,n      Open new empty buffer

,re     Recent open files
,rl     Revert current buffer (reload)

,d      Task-mode 'done'
,a      Task-mode 'archive all done'
,a      Task-mode 'new todo'

,l      List all open buffers (care, this mode is not evil-compatible!)

,c      Close current Window

,:      Command history (like vim recent commands, not perfect but close)
,f      Ace-Jump (i.e. Vim EasyMotion)

Omnicomnpletion:
mx omnicompletion-like-vim loads vim like omnicompletion for all words
s-. -> helm-complete-filename-at-point: press this for filename completion in a buffer
s-/ -> Hippie Expand, but doesn't have a menu either

Search:
helm-do-grep for fast grep in current diredtory and what not !
mx ack is a better and faster search then grep or helm-do-grep

Navigation:
C-` is the mode where each buffer shows a number
C-c SPC -> ace jump mode
C-u C-u C-c SPC” ⇒ ace-jump-line-mode
mx helm-bookmarks allows to set bookmarks to often-used files

Narrow / Widen:
- 'narrow-to-region
- 'widen

Zencoding:
<C-j>

lisp:
C-x C-e OR C-' -> Eval  Expression
C-5 (i.e. anstatt % (shift-5)) -> in evil visual selection of block form (), {}, [], ...

Paredit:
C-j => break and continue
C-d => forward-delete
M-d => forward-delete word
M-DEL => backwards delete word
M-<Up> => splice sexp killing backward (remove sexp before cursor)
M-<Down> => splice sexp killing forward (remove sexp before cursor)
M-r => raise sexp, some weird stuff that moves the current sexp up
C-) => (use caps lock + shift + 0) move the next sexp into the current one. cursor is *in* the current expression
C-} => move the next sexp away from the current one
C-( => (use caps lock + shift + 9) move the previous sexp into the current one. cursor is *in* the current expression
C-{ => move the previous sexp away from the current one

Twiddle-Mode
This is a program for testing hand-written HTTP requests. You write your request in an Emacs buffer (using http-twiddle-mode) and then press `C-c C-c' each time you want to try sending it to the server. This way you can interactively debug the requests. To change port or
destination do `C-u C-c C-c'.

The mode is activated by `M-x http-twiddle-mode' or automatically
when opening a filename ending with .http-twiddle.

Example buffer

POST / HTTP/1.0
Connection: close
Content-Length: $Content-Length

<The request body goes here>
